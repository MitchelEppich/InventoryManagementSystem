            "The yield is equally remarkable, reaching 500 g when grown indoors and 300 g outdoors.Theseare hefty amounts, given that every tiny part of Afghaniâ€™s huge, gorgeous, sparkling buds is absolutely packed with stinky and pungent goodness and a kind of satisfying body high you rarely ever get to find.They are unbelievably vibrant and dense.You would be surprised how much a single bud could weigh.",
            "These are the reasons our Afghani seeds have been making the rounds a long while.A lot of people love them for their full- bodied aroma and taste and heavy smoke.Afghani is indeed a great addition to your garden and collection and should be in the repository of all growers, regardless of how long you have been cultivating weed for recreational or medical purposes.",

          summary:
            "This classic original landrace strain gets its name from its origins. First discovered high in the mountainous regions of Afghanistan, this euphoric and relaxing Indica strain is perfect for cloning, cross breeding and large volume production.These are regular Afghani cannabis seeds. What 'regular' means is that all of these seeds are a mixture of both male and female. When they are grown, the males have to be separated so that they do not pollinate the females. If they are left together and pollinate, you'll have a bunch of seeds produced with no flowers made. So if your growing marijuana for producing flower to be used, its important to separate the plants once they start growing. An easy way to tell the difference between male and female plants is when the plants start to flower the males will produce pre flowers that are 'ball' shaped and the females will produce pre flowers that are 'pistil' shaped. Above average in THC, this well known classic is a must have for experienced or new growers.",
